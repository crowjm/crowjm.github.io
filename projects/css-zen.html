		<p class="project__sectionheader">About</p>
		<p>This project is based on <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, an exercise in the power of CSS. For this project, I was only allowed to edit the CSS file. I used ::before and ::after to create my layout. One requirement that we had in class that is different from the CSS Zen Garden requirements is that we had to use CSS animations. I was inspired by posters from the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Montreal and wanted to carry bold primary colors and '70s style design throughout this website.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Process &amp; Technology Used</p>
		<p>HTML, RWD, Sass, Bourbon, Illustrator.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</p>
		<p>The biggest challenge with this project was not being able to edit the HTML file. However, this ended up being a limitation that helped me grow. By having that limitation, I was forced to learn more about CSS and learn how to work with ::before and ::after.</p>
		<p>Another challenge I faced was bringing in Olympic inspiration without being obvious. To do this, I stuck colors found in the Olympic rings and also used Illustrator to create patterns inspired by Olympic posters.</p>
