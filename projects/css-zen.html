		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This project is based on <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, an exercise in the power of CSS. For this project, I was only allowed to edit the CSS file. I used ::before and ::after to create my layout. One requirement that we had in class that is different from the CSS Zen Garden requirements is that we had to use CSS animations.</p>
		<h2>Process &amp; Technology Used</h2>
		<p>HTML, CSS, RWD.</p>
		<h2>Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge with this project was not being able to edit the HTML file. However, this ended up being a limitation that helped me grow. By having that limitation, I was forced to learn more about CSS and learn how to work with ::before and ::after.</p>
