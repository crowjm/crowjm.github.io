		<p class="project__sectionheader">About</p>
		<p>This is a game I made for a talk I gave at ATXSass. Using Sass, the computer "knows" a number and the user tries to guess what it is. I wanted to explore using more logic in Sass and make the code as dry as I could.</p>

		<p class="project__sectionheader">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</p>
		<p>When I wrote the first version of the code for this game, it was very repetitive. I had a hunch that since I was applying the same code to different numbered classnames there would be a consolidated way to do so. I used mixins, interpolation, and control directives to dry out the code.</p>
