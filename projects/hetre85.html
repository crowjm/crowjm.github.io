		<p class="project-page-header">About</p>
		<p>This is a site I built for an Austin-based Rails developer. The primary function of the site is a blog, so I built the site using Jekyll.</p>
		<p>In addition to designing and developing this site, I designed a pattern and an icon set to be used in the footer and I also channeled my inner Draplin and designed a thick lines inspired logo.</p>
		<h3 class="project-page-header">Process &amp; Technology Used</h3>
		<p>HTML, RWD, Sass, Illustrator.</p>
		<h3 class="project-page-header">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</h3>
		<p>hetre really wanted his site to be simple and minimal, so a challenge I faced was balancing that requirement with making sure the website reflected his personality and didn't feel too plain. I accomplished this by bringing in a red for links and some headings and by utilizing the footer as a space that could have more personality without distracting from the content.</p>
