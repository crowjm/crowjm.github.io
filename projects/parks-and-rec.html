		<p class="project__sectionheader">About</p>
		<p>Parks &amp; Rec is my favorite show of all time. While rewatching it for the umteenth, I got the idea to do an illustration series of the main characters and their catchphrases. It was such a fun side project to work on to grow my illustration and lettering skills.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Process &amp; Technology Used</p>
		<p>Sketchbook, hand lettering, Photoshop, Illustrator.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</p>
		<p>This was my first in-depth illustration project. It was a challenge to make sure the different illustrations felt like a cohesive series when viewed together. To accomplish this, I used consistent illustration and lettering styles and for each piece.</p>
