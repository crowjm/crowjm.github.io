		<p class="project__sectionheader">About</p>
		<p>This is the static version of GreenThumb, an app idea I pitched and worked on during the TIY Hackathon (which you can read more about <a href="http://jessecrow.com/2015/03/02/TIY-Hackathon.html">here</a>). I was responsible for the design of the app, and have iterated on the design of it since the Hackathon to make it more app-like and to use new skills I've learned.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Process &amp; Technology Used</p>
		<p>HTML, Sass, RWD, JS Plugins, Illustrator.</p>
		<p class="project__sectionheader">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</p>
		<p>A challenge I faced while working on this project was breaking out of my common design habits and patterns. I tackled this head on during the iterative process and made the design have an app-like feel, added more elements to the footer, and used a different JS plugin for the nav. A problem I solved was thinking about the flow of the app and how the users should be led through the process of planning and planting and writing about their gardens.</p>
