		<p class="project-page-header">About</p>
		<p>This is the final project I completed for The Iron Yard. I had two weeks to take this project from research and discovery to the final live, coded version. I redesigned the main page of the National Park Service website and four pages of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park website. You can access the pages I redesigned for the Smokies by clicking "featured park" in the header of the National Park main page.</p>
		<p>The National Park Service is facing a problem of an aging visitor base. I had three goals for this project.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create a government website that is trustworthy and authoritative while being friendly and inviting.</li>
			<li>To streamline the tone of the social media accounts with their website.</li>
			<li>To create a cohesive design system that can be used from park to park.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="project-page-header">Process &amp; Technology Used</p>
		<p>Research: wordlist, SWOT analysis, competitive market study, website analysis, sketches, wireframes, styletiles, and comps.</p>
		<p>Technology: RWD, HTML, Sass, Typekit, Bourbon, JS, Modernizr, Photoshop, Illustrator.</p>
		<p class="project-page-header">Challenges Faced &amp; Problems Solved</p>
		<p>The main challenge I faced was making a government website feel trustworthy and authoritative while simultaneously feeling friendly and inviting. I achieved this through a consistent grid, the typefaces used, and the colors used. Another challenge I faced was designing the kids page for Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I needed to design it for kids (which is very different than designing for adults) and have it feel cohesive with the rest of the site. I accomplished this through using the same colors, typeface for body copy, and header and footer.</p>
