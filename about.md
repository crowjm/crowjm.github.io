	<h1>Howdy&#33; I'm Jesse.</h1>
	<p>I live in beautiful Austin, Texas. I love to cook, read, craft, be outside, and spend time with my dogs and fella.</p>
	<p>I'm currently studying web design at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> and am so excited about the world I'm jumping in to.</p>
	<p>I built this site as a way to practice what I'm learning, to share projects I'm working on, and to reflect on what I'm learning.</p>
