		<p><span class="about-intro">I'm Jesse.</span> I'm a UI design student at <a href="http://theironyard.com/courses/ui-design/">The Iron Yard.</a> Jumping into UI design is a natural progression of my love of making and communication. You can read more about how I got into design <a href="http://crowjm.github.io/2015/02/10/why-web-design.html">here.</a></p>
		<p>I was born and raised in the Deep South&mdash;Mississippi, humid summer nights, and "y'all" have a special place in my heart. I currently live in beautiful Austin, Texas with my fella and our two dogs. My favorite things about Austin are hiking at the Greenbelt, eating wanna BLTs &amp; tacos at Bouldin Creek Cafe, and finding new records at End of an Ear.</p>
		<p>I'm a big believer that tech can make the world a better place and want to work with good, hard-working people who think the same.</p>
