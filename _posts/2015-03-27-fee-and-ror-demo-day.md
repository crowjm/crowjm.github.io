Today the Front End and Rails classes had their demo day&mdash;I can't believe 12 weeks has already gone by!

Seeing a demo day first hand was a really awesome experience (and it helped calm my already happening jitters about my demo day in three weeks). It was set up science fair style, so everyone had a station set up with a big monitor displaying their final project, business cards, a name tag, etc. People could then move from station to station and I think there was a lot less pressure on the students since (at least from what I could see) presentations were very conversational. 

I'm so amazed and impressed with what my classmates and friends created in two weeks and how much they've learned in twelve! If they're the future of engineering, it's in <em>very</em> good hands.
