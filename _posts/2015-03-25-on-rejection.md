excerpt: Rejection isn't the important part. How you handle rejection is what's important. Rejection is awful and it can really drag you down-but you don't have to let it. It's okay to be sad for a little while, but then channel that sadness into something bigger and better.

Yesterday I turned twenty-five. Yesterday I also got a rejection letter from a conference I applied to speak at. Needless to say, I'm feeling a little blue.

Getting rejected wasn't something that crossed my mind when I applied. It's not an arrogance thing; I know that I'm still so new in this world and that I have a _lot_ left to learn. It's because I don't visualize rejection when trying to reach a goal. Why would I? When I think about my goals, I only visualize myself reaching them; I only want to put good, positive energy towards them. This is both a blessing and a curse. I'm great at staying positive, but when I do face rejection, it really hurts.

I was already crafting my talk (which I'm now pivoting into a blog post, so stay tuned!). I was picturing myself, a week after demo day, leaving the nest of The Iron Yard, giving a talk downtown, meeting new people, and taking the world by storm.  

I was in a very similar position seven years ago when I turned eighteen. I got a rejection letter from UT, one of my top choice colleges. As an out of state applicant, I knew getting in was a long shot and actively tried not to get my hopes up. But I still pictured myself in the big city, learning things I didn't even know I could learn about, going to a show every night, and eating lots of tacos. I was really upset, but it all worked out. I attended the tiny, liberal arts college of my dreams (Go Majors!), made some of the best friends I could ever hope to have, received an education unlike any other, and had incredible mentors. I also fell in love with the city, which meant I stuck around for a couple years after graduation, made even more fantastic friends, met my wonderful fella, and we rescued our two dogs.

Rejection happens for a reason.

Getting rejected from speaking at a conference might not have the same life changing effect as choosing where to go to college, but there's a reason. Maybe it'll prepare me for rejection as I start my job search in a couple of weeks. Maybe I'll get tickets to a private Bonnie Prince Billy show on the same day. Maybe I'll _still_ be napping and recovering from the twelve most intense weeks of my life. Who knows. 

Rejection isn't the important part. How you handle rejection is what's important. Rejection is awful and it can really drag you down-but you don't have to let it. It's okay to be sad for a little while, but then channel that sadness into something bigger and better. I'm not going to let this discourage me from putting myself out there. I'm only going to put myself out there more and dream bigger.
