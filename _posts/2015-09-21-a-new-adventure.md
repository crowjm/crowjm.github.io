For the past month and a half, I've been searching for my next job, which has been an adventure in and of itself. One of the pieces of advice I heard over and over while in school was to not settle. I really took that to heart and wanted to make sure I found a job where I could consistenly contribute and be challenged and grow at a fantastic company.  

Exciting news: my search is over! I accepted an offer from <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM Design</a> and will start as a front end developer in January! 

I can't wait to get started and am counting down the days until Design Camp! I'm also really looking forward to the transistion from design to development and to spend more time coding and programming &#40;although I'll still work on design-oriented side projects&#41;.
