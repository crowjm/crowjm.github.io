I can't believe it's already 2016! Time has flown by, especially because I've been getting acclimated to a new job, new workflow, and learning so many new things. 

2016 will be my first full year as a developer/designer, and I want to make sure I make the most of it. I'm only starting to scatch the surface of things to learn and I'm in awe of all the things I don't know that I don't know (and very excited to learn about them!). 

To stay on track, I made a list of goals I want to accomplish this year. You can find them over on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/crowjm/2016-goals">here</a>. I've started breaking things down into managable steps and I think hosting my goals on GitHub will be a good way to easily edit and add things, stay on track/be held accountable, and get feedback on resources, etc.
