Y'all, somehow the time has flown by and I'm starting my final project. This is not a drill.

I'm feeling excited and inspired and a little overwhelmed about just how much work I have to get done in the next two weeks. I know I'm capable and armed with a fantastic schedule to stick with, but sometimes the size and importance of this project gets the best of me. Mostly I'm trying to shush the thoughts of "you only have ___ days left here" that have become more frequent.

For my final project, I'm going to redesign the home page of the National Park Service website and four pages from Great Smoky Mountains National Park's website. So far I've done my research, created a word list, done brand/reputation, competitor, and SWOT analyses, considered the audience, come up with a list of potential concepts, and done sketches based on the strongest three concepts. Seems like a lot (and it is), but it's only a small drop compared to what's to come. 

I just need to keep in mind this mantra from Leslie Knope:
