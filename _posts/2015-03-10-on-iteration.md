excerpt: Iteration helps you move past the obvious, explore ideas fully, and craft the best work possible. Because of iteration, I felt like I was getting to put all of my effort into the best concepts, and that's a satisfying feeling.

The past couple of days, we've learned about logo design. We've spent time discussing what make a logo successful or unsuccessful and have jumped in to making a logo for our restaurant redesign project. 

I started by revising the wordlist I created when we started the restaurant redesign project. I used my original list, but flushed it out more. From there, I created a morphological matrix. I based the categories of my morphological matrix on common themes in my wordlist. I then went back and color coded the categories with associated words. Using a morphological matrix is an awesome way to come up with new ideas and explore what happens when you put two different things together; it helps you move past the obvious.

After creating the matrix, our assignment was to come up with fifty ideas for logos. FIFTY whole ideas?! At first I didn't think it would be possible, but thanks to the matrix it wasn't too hard to do. One thing I had to get over very quickly at this point in the process is my lack of drawing skills. I do great in general arts and crafts, but drawing has never been my strong suit. As it turns out, it doesn't matter as long as I can get the point across. At this point in the process, I also felt very thankful for Illustrator.

Today we had a critique of the logos we created yesterday. Out of the fifty I made yesterday, seven of mine were chosen for iteration. Iteration is such an important part of designing a logo. Iteration helps you move past the obvious, explore ideas fully, and craft the best work possible. I came up with sixty new versions today and I'm much more proud of most of them than the fifty I created yesterday. I felt like I was getting to put all of my effort into the best concepts, and that's a satisfying feeling. I have a couple of favorites that I want to pursue more, but I have to remember to not be married to a concept.
