There are so many things that are possible with design and front end development. One of the best ways I've found to learn a new skill is to recreate.

What this looks like for me (most of the times) is scrolling through CodePen, finding myself in awe of a Pen, and setting out to make something similar on my own.

Earlier this week, I found [this Pen by Made on Mars.](http://codepen.io/made-on-mars/pen/JROYzo) Isn't it gorgeous?! I'm working on upping my animation skills, and having an SVG appear drawn on the page as you scroll down is something I hadn't thought of. After a few minutes of scrolling up and down I knew this was something I wanted to learn how to do. 

The HTML and CSS were straightforward. I used an SVG I made of a bouquet of flowers and made sure I had classes attached to the correct elements. I've worked with animating this SVG before, so I had stroke-dashoffset values for all the components. For this Pen, I wanted to keep the CSS simple, so I used the largest stroke-dashoffset value for all of the elements.

I focused mostly on the JS for this Pen. The original Pen by Made on Mars uses jQuery. Since I usually work with vanilla JS at work, I knew I wanted to rewrite the JS accordingly. This is where things got trickyâ€”and where I learned the most! The Pen I used for inspiration didn't have any comments, so I had to figure the logic on my own. The main things I learned about are clientHeight, innerHeight, scrollHeight, scrollY.

I had a lot of fun making this pen and can't wait to put the skills I improved to use again.
