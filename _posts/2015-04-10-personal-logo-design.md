In the midst of final projects, our class also worked on our personal logos and business cards. Designing something for myself is one of the most challenging things I've done so far in this class. 

I've put so much additional (and probably unnecessary) pressure on myself for my logo to be perfect. Not just design wise, but I've also felt like it has to be the perfect representation of myself. This, coupled with just turning twenty-five a couple weeks ago, has led me to feel like I'm in the thick of a quarter life crisis. 

I started by asking family, friends, and Sam what five words and a color they associate with me to get an idea as to how others perceive me. Then our class doing a timed logo challenge like we did earlier in the cohort. From there, I sketched and iterated ideas, brought them into Illustrator, and iterated and iterated and iterated and fussed with pen tool points until I was satisfied.

My two main concepts were a bird and a mason jar. I ultimately decided to go with the mason jar because it has more depth and goes past the obvious (my last name is Crow, afterall). We got our business cards today and I'm over the moon with how they turned out and still can't believe I'm getting into a world where I get to have business cards.
