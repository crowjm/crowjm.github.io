We're moving full steam ahead with our restaurant redesign projects! We've gotten a lot done since I last blogged about [it](http://crowjm.github.io/2015/02/22/exploring-typography.html). Since we've hit the halfway point (!!!) we're going to be working on at least one project a week for rest of the semester.

Last week and over the weekend, we had to take our projects from 3 sets of sketches of the menu section to 3 sets of wireframes, pick the final layout, create comps, and code a responsive site with two addition pages. It sounds like a ton of work (and it was), but we kept a steady pace. Breaking it into smaller assignments to accomplish each day made the project seem much less overwhelming. As my Mama says, "the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time."

I hit a rut when designing the home page. I felt like none of the ideas I tried matched the whacky and wonderful personality of the restaurant I'm working on. After looking at some ideas on [Site Inspire](http://www.siteinspire.com/), I found one concept that worked: big and bold color blocks. I'm not sure if it's the most effective way to present the information, but it's a good starting point for iteration. If you'd like to see what I've created thus far, you can find it [here](http://crowjm.github.io/tiy_assignments/day_29/bouldin_redesign/index.html). 

We got feedback on our designs from our classmates and from Sam and will be revising soon. This week we're jumping into the world of logo design and also working on [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). I'm excited to be working on two very different projects at the same time.
