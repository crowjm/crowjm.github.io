There is so much that I want to learn and try and do and make. I have a running list of projects I want to start, skills I want to learn, meals I want to cook, etc. â€” and it's extensive. Why aren't I making something every day?

I've been making excuses. I'm too tired from work, I need to find the right tutorial, maybe once I'm better at Illustrator I can get into more illustration-heavy projects, and so on. Yesterday, when I sat down with Illustrator and made an illustrated portrait of one of my dogs (which I am so proud of, y'all), I realized all of these excuses are complete nonsense. So what if I'm tired? Make a cup of tea and go for a little walk. Who says I need a tutorial, I've got a brain and can figure this out! And spoiler alert, self, the only way I'm going to get better at anything is to do the thing, make the thing, pick up the tools and create and revise and create some more.

Being a new designer is hard, but it's not a reason to not try. 

I'm feeling inspired and empowered, and I'm starting the 100 Days Project! You can read more about the 100 Days Project <a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days">here</a>. I'm <em>so</em> excited to make and create and do and learn and grow. I've added a section to this site where you can <a href="http://jessecrow.com/100days">follow along</a> and see what I'm making.
