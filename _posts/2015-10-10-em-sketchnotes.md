Yesterday I sat in on a Q&amp;A session with <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a> at The Iron Yard. Ethan is the creator of responsive web design(!), which is the methodology I learned to design websites. I feel very lucky to have been there and to learn first-hand from someone who's had such an impact on web design. Thanks, Ethan!
