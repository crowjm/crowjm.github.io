##Why Web Design?
I moved to Austin in search of new opportunities. I worked in retail, office management, and social media marketing before and couldn't see myself making a career in any of those fields. I was very lost in terms of job direction and itching to find something I enjoy doing that I could turn into a career.  

Enter web design.  

I started doing some online tutorials to get my feet wet. I was hooked after the first one. I was thrilled to use my brain again in a way I hadn't since college, learn new and relevant skills, and think critically and creatively. And one day it dawned on me: _web design is related to my college degree; I CAN USE MY DEGREE IN THE REAL WORLD!_ 

I graduated from Millsaps College with a B.A. in [Communication Studies](http://www.millsaps.edu/academic_departments/department_of_communications.php). With everything I studied, I kept the media triangle (the consumer, the producer, and the text/product&mdash;and their relationship) in mind. I think my academic background will play a part in my process and what I create, and I'm excited to take a step back and analyze what I make from a Communication Studies perspective.

The Communication Studies tie in became very apparent with an article we read early in the second week of class. In the forward to [_Practical Typography_](http://practicaltypography.com/foreword.html), Erik Spiek­er­mann writes, "If you fail to consider the effect of your message on the recipient, you may inadvertently communicate that you do not care how your message may be received." Effect, message, recipient, received&mdash;these words brought me right back to college lectures. 

Web design is more than just making things look pretty. You have to think critically and creatively and solve problems while building your site. You also have to consider the messages of your site. I'm excited to do all of these things.
