I'm almost halfway done with my 100 Days challenge. Where has the time gone?! I'm more thankful that I'm doing this sort of challenge every day that passes.

Here's some of what I've learned from this challenge so far:

<ul class="blog-list">
	<li>It's much easier to make something when I have a clear plan of what I want to make (big surprise). I've learned that if I don't have a clear plan of action, my designs end up all over the place and less successful than designs that I've thought out. I'm starting to hone in on that by having one theme that I work off of. Currently I'm working on a series of Austin icons, focusing on using shapes and shading.</li>
	<li>I need to have a notebook with me at all times to keep track of ideas, sketch, and practice lettering. On my desk, in my purse, on my bedside table.</li>
	<li>On days when I'm exhausted and/or stressed, I'm more likely to bake something than design something.</li>
	<li>I do my best work in the morning, before the pups wake up. No distractions and not having anything else from the day to worry about means that I can focus better on the task at hand.</li>
	<li>There are ways to get out of a rut. Early in the challenge when I would get stumped, I would give myself a hard time. Now I look through my notebooks for ideas or pick a course to complete on <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes">Skillshare</a>.</li>
	<li>I have more fun working on something that pushes what I know, not projects that play it safe.</li>
	<li>I stay more in my zone when listening to music. And the music is important! I'll share a playlist of what's been on heavy rotation on the blog soon.</li>
