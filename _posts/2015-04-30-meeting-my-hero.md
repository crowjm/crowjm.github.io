Today was a great day because I got to meet my design hero, <a href="http://draplin.com/">Aaron Draplin</a>. 

I love Draplin's work because it's bold and timeless. It's something to aspire to. My work isn't all #thicklines like Draplin's, but I want to make things that won't fade as trends change.

With encouragement from a dear friend and a rush of adrenalin, I walked up to Draplin while he was setting up the merch booth before his talk, introduced myself, and asked him if he had any advice for new designers. Highlights include: don't move to Portland, do work you love, and people are going to try to make design not fun&mdash;avoid them.

I also got to sit front row for his talk with my teacher, Sam. It was hilarious and inspiring and so good to hear, especially as a new designer. Highlights from the talk include: 
<ul>
	<li>show the things you love</li>
	<li>it takes work to make good design</li>
	<li>document your process</li>
	<li><em>think about how much time we throw away and invent your life with that time</em></li>
	<li>you don't have to take the carrot</li>
	<li>get out there and get dirty</li>
	<li>there's beauty in restraint</li>
	<li>Illustrator won't teach you anything</li>
</ul>

It all boils down to one thing: "work hard and love this shit."
