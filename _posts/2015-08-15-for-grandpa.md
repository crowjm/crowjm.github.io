When I started my blog, I wanted its sole purpose to be documenting my journey as a designer. I was very adamant that I would keep my personal life out of it. But life shows up and the line between the two gets blurred and here we are.

I love design because it creates order in chaos. I love design because good design mandates empathy and inclusiveness. And new to my list of why I love design is that it's a way to feel closer to people I've lost.

Yesterday marked six weeks since my Grandpa passed away. I've mostly been in a state of denial and have tried to bury it deep down. But lately I've found myself thinking about it more often and have started to unpack everything. I'll have flashbacks to the call I got from my Dad telling me that if I wanted to see Grandpa I needed to come now. Back to the ICU at the VA Hospital in Little Rock—the glow and noises of all the machines, the complete silence and eerie, unsettling feeling of the common area of the hospital at 3am. Back to the hospice floor—sneaking a nap on the couch in the family room, the Air Force blanket on Grandpa's bed. 

When we were sorting through belongings the weekend of the funeral, my Mama gave me two albums of photos that Grandpa took in the Blue Ridge Mountains. She told me she thought I would be able to use them and they are the absolute best thing I could have inherited. They've been tucked away until today.

I sorted through the photos and there was one that I kept going back to. I knew the perfect quote to go with it, so I lettered it, brought it into Illustrator and cleaned it up, and added it to the photo. It's comforting to be able to make things with the photos and have a sense of connection. I'm excited for all the other projects I can use them in and to keep making, keep remembering.
