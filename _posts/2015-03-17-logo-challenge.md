excerpt: I had a blast with this assignment. It very much felt like a summer camp activity and it was a really fun way to get comfortable with not editing in my head. I learned that putting down the obvious, just getting it out of my system, helps me move past it and onto better design.

Today we spent class time talking about logos. We watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/113751583">this</a> video where the incredible &amp; inspirational Aaron Draplin designs a logo in 15 minutes. Our take away was "see how much you can do if you don't edit in your head and put every idea down?!".

Sam put that take away to the test with the most insane and fun logo challenge. We all cleared our desks of everything except for a pack of sticky notes and a Sharpie. Every 30 seconds Sam would say a new topic and we had to sketch as many ideas as we could. And we had a Sharpie, so we had to <em>commit</em>. Topics included: SXSW, a library, tacos, water, Valentine's Day (but no hearts allowed), beer, and email. We sketched for what seems like hours, but I think it was closer to thirty minutes.

We took a short break and then picked our five favorite sketches to bring into Illustrator. I chose an Austin dentist, a quilt conference, women in tech, the Oregon Trail, and a library.

The challenge wasn't over when we moved into Illustrator. We had to create 10 different logos of each concept, and had to (try to) stick to 1 minute for each. I ended up spending about 3 minutes on each one, but I was able to move around Illustrator faster than I expected.
