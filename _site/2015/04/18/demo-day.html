		<p>Yesterday was Demo Day and the end of my Iron Yard experience. Demo Day (and being at The Iron Yard in general) went by in the blink of an eye and it all feels like a blur. I can’t believe it’s over.</p>

<p>Our Demo Day was set up science fair style, meaning it was conversation based, not pitch based, which took a lot of the pressure off.  I was so excited to share my final project (which you can find <a href="http://jessecrow.com/projects/nationalparks.html">here</a>) and talk about all I learned. I’m also very thankful to have a supportive fella, friends, and former co-workers who all came by to see my work.</p>

<p>Talking about my final projects with others and seeing it in the wild was such a rewarding experience. It’s my capstone project that I’ve worked on for 14-16 hours a day for almost two weeks, that I’ve poured my heart into, that is an extension of me and everything I know as a designer and developer. I’m proud of the work I’ve done and all that I’ve learned.</p>

<p>After Demo Day wrapped up, my cohort, our plus ones, and the teachers and staff went out to eat pizza and drink beer (treat yo’self) and then I went to see Sleater-Kinney with one of my dear friends and classmates. I don’t know what’s going to happen next, but I’m so excited for what’s to come.</p>
