		<p>Our first website sketching assignment sent me into a state of panic. I had to fight my inner perfectionist and accept having what I considered major flaws in my work (and consequently share work I wasn’t proud of).</p>

<p>We were assigned ten websites that we had to sketch on a grid. And we had to use pen. PEN. I knew I would make mistakes and there would be nothing I could do to correct them and that’s when the panic began. </p>

<p>My instructor, Sam, talked about how sketches don’t have to be perfect, how they shouldn’t be perfect. They’re an important first step in the design process and they should be done quickly to get ideas down on the page.</p>

<p>That sounded great until I started drawing crooked lines and divs in the wrong place. Even though I knew my sketches shouldn’t be perfect, I put pressure on myself to make them so. I felt like they couldn’t be used because they had mistakes.</p>

<p>We had to share our worst sketch the next day in class. I was terrified at first, but then I realized we all had mistakes. Lines weren’t straight, proportions were off, etc. What I had built up to be horrendous mistakes <em>weren’t mistakes at all</em>. The layouts of the sites were still conveyed and we could understand what the others had sketched. And that’s the whole point.</p>
