		<p>Our big homework assignment over the weekend was to create ten different typographical concepts for our restaurant project. I'm very excited about this project because the restaurant I'm working on, <a href="http://www.bouldincreek.com/start.asp">Bouldin Creek Cafe</a>, is my favorite spot in Austin. And, we're finally designing!</p>
<p>I started by making a word list, which appropriately felt like I was compiling a gigantic love letter to Bouldin Creek Cafe. I wrote down my own thoughts, talked to a couple of friends and Sam, and browsed reviews on Yelp. My list includes people, places, things, and what was most useful: adjectives. After I had my list, I looked it over and started putting items together to create my concepts. Sam said in lecture on Friday, "good design is getting past the obvious." I had to really think creatively and critically, but I think I have some concepts that go past the obvious.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/bouldin-wordlist.jpg" alt="wordlist for Bouldin Creek Cafe" class="half-size-image" /></p>
<p>From there, I mapped out my concepts a little by picking fonts and colors. Not all of these stayed the same once I was making them on Typecast. I worked better and more efficiently with all of my notes written down in one place.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/concepts-brainstorm.jpg" alt="a list of different concetps for Bouldin Creek Cafe" /></p>
<p>The last step was actually creating my concepts in Typecast. I had never used Typecast before and I had some serious frustrations the first two-three hours I used it. I finally figured out a good work flow and was able to move much quicker and without feeling like I wanted to scream every few seconds.</p>
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/bouldin-1-keep-austin-weird">Bouldin 1: Keep Austin Weird</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Bouldin is delightfully weird. I chose Expo Sans Pro for the typeface for this concept. It's strong, yet funky and warm. For the colors, I chose bright green, blue, red, and orange on a pale yellow background. My color choices were inspired by the Keep Austin Weird tie dye shirts. This is my most obvious concept, and I'm honestly not too proud of it.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/4baafc81d2d191397f8f8bba0e1d271595638e99vRZ9r">Bouldin 2: Down Home Sit and Stay a While</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Bouldin is a place where you can go dine with friends and not feel rushed. In that way, it reminds me of a lot of places in the Deep South. I chose Adelle for the typeface for this concept because it's unobtrusive, interesting, and easy to read. It's almost as if Adelle is inviting you to stay on the words and take your time reading. I went with a cozy color palate. A friendly, deep blue for the background and pale yellow, blue, green, and grey for the text.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/1b79e4448ac6f800173b29b266982e87dd4aa19bYx4DB8">Bouldin 3: Sunny/Frog/Cacti</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Looking at Bouldin's frog logo, past the cacti on a sunny day is the inspiration for this concept. For the h elements, I used the outdoorsy Chippewa Falls typeface. It's got a retro look and is inspired by signs at Chippewa Falls, a natural spring in Wisconsin. For the rest of the elements, I used DejaRip. For colors, I chose a bright Texas sky blue, bright orange-red and red-orange, a deep blue, and a cacti green.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/541d517616ba8c4d758e714ee0699b641685b7efM">Bouldin 4: Old Auto Shop Meets Bouldin 2</a></h5>
<!-- <p>The current Bouldin location is an old auto shop. They have tires hanging from the ceiling and kept some of the old lettering in the windows. I paired the auto shop idea with the sit and stay a while idea and my brain couldn't stop thinking about it. I used Orgovan Rounded for the h elements and menu item names. It's very similar to the lettering in the window. I kept the rest in Adelle and kept the colors the same as concept 2.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/6b09c30f21c622e9f3a1d6fd4362df504ddbaafcFZfmf">Bouldin 5: Simple and Comfortable</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Bouldin is a simple and comfortable place. Runda is a simple, easy to read typeface. I kept the colors simple and easy to read as well and incorporated comfortable colors like a deep, friendly blue and a bright yellow.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/35a1fd7df7c259cbd72e41ea3cf9616d00077922z4ZW">Bouldin 6: Artsy and Indie</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Bouldin is artsy and indie in decor and people: from the rotating artists' work, stickers covering the front door, bicycle wheel chandeliers, the vegetable strong man painting, and the mural out back to the people who work and frequent there. I chose Raleway for the typeface. It's strong, stands out, and unlike any other typeface I've seen. I went with a deep teal background and white, light blue, and bright yellow colors. Friendly, unique, and complementary. Because of layout limitations of Typecast, this one ended up no where near how I imagined it would.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/fef20abcf7e78751f45c605850f95c45f24c5fb0">Bouldin 7: Friendly and Home-y</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Everyone at Bouldin is the nicest person you've ever met and going to Bouldin feels like going to your second home. Rooney is the typeface for this concept. It feels rooted in the page, like it couldn't be moved even if you tried. It's also easy to rea -->
<!-- d and warm. I chose friendly blues, a love inspired red-orange, and a cheery yellow-orange for the colors.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/0d0b1d464b554820829e1134d2b2b5e84871d0d2LC8fBvpkcw">Bouldin 8: Neon Signs/Old Auto Shop/78704</a></h5>
<!-- <p>This concept is inspired by Bouldin's neon sign, its history as an old auto shop, and 78704 in general. The typeface used is Expressway, which is based on the typeface used on interstate signs. I thought this fit perfectly with the old auto shop history and it reminded me of the 78704 bumper sticker that looks like a road sign. I used a black background with bright red, green, blue, and yellow, colors found on their neon sign.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/80bfb7f7bf0c4f63275cc9713bbdf062952bb7fecjcWVjx">Bouldin 9: Eclectic and Authentic</a></h5>
<!-- <p>As quirky as Bouldin is, none of it is an act. It's a place where you can be who you are. I chose Montserrat for the typeface for h elements. It's based on old posters and signs found in the Montserrat neighborhood in Buenos Aires and is an eclectic typeface without being over the top. For the rest of the elements, I chose Open Sans. It pairs well with Montserrat and since it is a humanistic sans-serif, it feels real and authentic. For colors, I chose a deep teal background (both quirky and friendly/inviting) and used many of the colors from concept 8.</p> -->
<h5><a href="http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/2543348512b36c635eb40e24dc8cc1d0424d81c76gwb">Bouldin 10: Quintessential Family/Friends/Date Night Spot</a></h5>
<!-- <p>Bouldin was the first place I ate in Austin, my favorite date spot, and the place I take all of my out of town guests. I chose Freight Sans Pro for the typeface. It feels friendly, inviting, and fun. I used many of the same cozy colors I did in concepts 2 and 4. I added in a pink because one of the words that came up a lot was "love" and I felt it important to incorporate that in this concept.</p> -->
