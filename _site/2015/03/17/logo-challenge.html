		<p>Today we spent class time talking about logos. We watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/113751583">this</a> video where the incredible &amp; inspirational Aaron Draplin designs a logo in 15 minutes. Our take away was “see how much you can do if you don’t edit in your head and put every idea down?!”.</p>

<p>Sam put that take away to the test with the most insane and fun logo challenge. We all cleared our desks of everything except for a pack of sticky notes and a Sharpie. Every 30 seconds Sam would say a new topic and we had to sketch as many ideas as we could. And we had a Sharpie, so we had to <em>commit</em>. Topics included: SXSW, a library, tacos, water, Valentine’s Day (but no hearts allowed), beer, and email. We sketched for what seems like hours, but I think it was closer to thirty minutes. </p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/logo-challenge1.JPG" alt="some of my logo sketches" />
<br /></p>

<p>We took a short break and then picked our five favorite sketches to bring into Illustrator. I chose an Austin dentist, a quilt conference, women in tech, the Oregon Trail, and a library.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/logo-challenge-top5.JPG" alt="top 5 logo sketches" />
<br /></p>

<p>The challenge wasn’t over when we moved into Illustrator. We had to create 10 different logos of each concept, and had to (try to) stick to 1 minute for each. I ended up spending about 3 minutes on each one, but I was able to move around Illustrator faster than I expected.  </p>

<br /></p>

<p>I had a blast with this assignment. It very much felt like a summer camp activity and it was a really fun way to get comfortable with not editing in my head. I learned that putting down the obvious, just getting it out of my system, helps me move past it and onto better design. </p>
