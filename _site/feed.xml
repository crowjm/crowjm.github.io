        <title>Logo Challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we spent class time talking about logos. We watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/113751583&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; video where the incredible &amp;amp; inspirational Aaron Draplin designs a logo in 15 minutes. Our take away was “see how much you can do if you don’t edit in your head and put every idea down?!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam put that take away to the test with the most insane and fun logo challenge. We all cleared our desks of everything except for a pack of sticky notes and a Sharpie. Every 30 seconds Sam would say a new topic and we had to sketch as many ideas as we could. And we had a Sharpie, so we had to &lt;em&gt;commit&lt;/em&gt;. Topics included: SXSW, a library, tacos, water, Valentine’s Day (but no hearts allowed), beer, and email. We sketched for what seems like hours, but I think it was closer to thirty minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/logo-challenge1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;some of my logo sketches&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a short break and then picked our five favorite sketches to bring into Illustrator. I chose an Austin dentist, a quilt conference, women in tech, the Oregon Trail, and a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/logo-challenge-top5.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;top 5 logo sketches&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge wasn’t over when we moved into Illustrator. We had to create 10 different logos of each concept, and had to (try to) stick to 1 minute for each. I ended up spending about 3 minutes on each one, but I was able to move around Illustrator faster than I expected.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/logo-challenge-illustrator.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;working in illustrator&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a blast with this assignment. It very much felt like a summer camp activity and it was a really fun way to get comfortable with not editing in my head. I learned that putting down the obvious, just getting it out of my system, helps me move past it and onto better design. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Logos and Iteration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The past couple of days, we’ve learned about logo design. We’ve spent time discussing what make a logo successful or unsuccessful and have jumped in to making a logo for our restaurant redesign project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by revising the wordlist I created when we started the restaurant redesign project. I used my original list, but flushed it out more. From there, I created a morphological matrix. I based the categories of my morphological matrix on common themes in my wordlist. I then went back and color coded the categories with associated words. Using a morphological matrix is an awesome way to come up with new ideas and explore what happens when you put two different things together; it helps you move past the obvious.
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/restaurant-wordlist.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;restaurant wordlist&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the matrix, our assignment was to come up with fifty ideas for logos. FIFTY whole ideas?! At first I didn’t think it would be possible, but thanks to the matrix it wasn’t too hard to do. One thing I had to get over very quickly at this point in the process is my lack of drawing skills. I do great in general arts and crafts, but drawing has never been my strong suit. As it turns out, it doesn’t matter as long as I can get the point across. At this point in the process, I also felt very thankful for Illustrator.

&lt;img src=&quot;/img/restaurant-firstlogos-2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Restaurant Logos, First Round&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had a critique of the logos we created yesterday. Out of the fifty I made yesterday, seven of mine were chosen for iteration. Iteration is such an important part of designing a logo. Iteration helps you move past the obvious, explore ideas fully, and craft the best work possible. I came up with sixty new versions today and I’m much more proud of most of them than the fifty I created yesterday. I felt like I was getting to put all of my effort into the best concepts, and that’s a satisfying feeling. I have a couple of favorites that I want to pursue more, but I have to remember to not be married to a concept.

        <title>Restaurant Redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re moving full steam ahead with our restaurant redesign projects! We’ve gotten a lot done since I last blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;http://crowjm.github.io/2015/02/22/exploring-typography.html&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;. Since we’ve hit the halfway point (!!!) we’re going to be working on at least one project a week for rest of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week and over the weekend, we had to take our projects from 3 sets of sketches of the menu section to 3 sets of wireframes, pick the final layout, create comps, and code a responsive site with two addition pages. It sounds like a ton of work (and it was), but we kept a steady pace. Breaking it into smaller assignments to accomplish each day made the project seem much less overwhelming. As my Mama says, “the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit a rut when designing the home page. I felt like none of the ideas I tried matched the whacky and wonderful personality of the restaurant I’m working on. After looking at some ideas on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siteinspire.com/&quot;&gt;Site Inspire&lt;/a&gt;, I found one concept that worked: big and bold color blocks. I’m not sure if it’s the most effective way to present the information, but it’s a good starting point for iteration. If you’d like to see what I’ve created thus far, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://crowjm.github.io/tiy_assignments/day_29/bouldin_redesign/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got feedback on our designs from our classmates and from Sam and will be revising soon. This week we’re jumping into the world of logo design and also working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csszengarden.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;. I’m excited to be working on two very different projects at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TIY Hackathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marked the end of the TIY Austin Hackathon. The past four days have been some of the most demanding and challenging yet. It was our first big project to design everything on our own (and our first group project). I can’t believe we’re finally at this point!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hackathon started Thursday afternoon with idea pitches. I pitched a couple of ideas, but my favorite was for an app that would help you plan your garden. After pitches, the instructors picked the ideas that were realistic to get done in such a short amount of time. From there, we split into teams. Each team had one Ruby on Rails developer, one front end developer, and one designer (or front end student acting as designer). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My garden app idea (which one of my teammates, Drew, thought to call GreenThumb) ended up being what my team worked on and I was over the moon to bring it from concept to reality!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday afternoon was spent planning. I sketched out different layout ideas, made wireframes for the final version and worked on design research. I was feeling very stuck in terms of design. I could hear my instructor, Sam, saying “good design moves past the obvious” over and over in my head, but all I could think of were greens, yellows, blues, and garden beds. Too obvious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning, my teammate Alex and I pair programmed the html and basic framework for the app. It was refreshing to work with someone else and to be coding in a new environment (inside a Rails app structure, not just a regular, static html page). When we were done, I started thinking of design concepts again, and that’s when it hit me: Victory Garden posters! Historical references, creating a feeling of responsibility, patriotism, and pride, and beautiful color palettes to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of Friday creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crowjm/GreenThumb-Design-Planning/blob/master/GreenThumb_StyleTile.psd&quot;&gt;style tile&lt;/a&gt; and getting basic design done. Our apps had to be responsive, so I wanted to get the basic flow of elements done before I went too deep into the design elements. I was able to get most things wrapped up by Saturday afternoon and then I worked on the design. Saturday evening rolled around, and I just wasn’t happy with what I had done. It felt bland and lacking personality. I jumped into Photoshop and made a hero image to replace what was then green text on a blue background. I still felt like it wasn’t enough. So, I ventured into Illustrator and made some carrots (which I am SO proud of, y’all). I wasn’t sure how I was going to incorporate them, but I knew they were the missing piece. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday afternoon I went to campus to meet with my teammates and get help from Sam with an nth-of-type issue I had. I was lucky enough to also get a design critique. Critiques used to terrify me, but I got over it after realizing how much of a valuable tool in the design process. People can steer you in the right direction if you get off track, point out things you might not realize, and/or let you know that you’re on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, we presented our projects. It was a relief and was so neat to see what everyone else had worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to check out GreenThumb, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenthumbapp.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the features are still in the works. I’ll be iterating the design in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring Typography</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our big homework assignment over the weekend was to create ten different typographical concepts for our restaurant project. I&#39;m very excited about this project because the restaurant I&#39;m working on, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bouldincreek.com/start.asp&quot;&gt;Bouldin Creek Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, is my favorite spot in Austin. And, we&#39;re finally designing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by making a word list, which appropriately felt like I was compiling a gigantic love letter to Bouldin Creek Cafe. I wrote down my own thoughts, talked to a couple of friends and Sam, and browsed reviews on Yelp. My list includes people, places, things, and what was most useful: adjectives. After I had my list, I looked it over and started putting items together to create my concepts. Sam said in lecture on Friday, &quot;good design is getting past the obvious.&quot; I had to really think creatively and critically, but I think I have some concepts that go past the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bouldin-wordlist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wordlist for Bouldin Creek Cafe&quot; class=&quot;half-size-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I mapped out my concepts a little by picking fonts and colors. Not all of these stayed the same once I was making them on Typecast. I worked better and more efficiently with all of my notes written down in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/concepts-brainstorm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a list of different concetps for Bouldin Creek Cafe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step was actually creating my concepts in Typecast. I had never used Typecast before and I had some serious frustrations the first two-three hours I used it. I finally figured out a good work flow and was able to move much quicker and without feeling like I wanted to scream every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/bouldin-1-keep-austin-weird&quot;&gt;Bouldin 1: Keep Austin Weird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Bouldin is delightfully weird. I chose Expo Sans Pro for the typeface for this concept. It&#39;s strong, yet funky and warm. For the colors, I chose bright green, blue, red, and orange on a pale yellow background. My color choices were inspired by the Keep Austin Weird tie dye shirts. This is my most obvious concept, and I&#39;m honestly not too proud of it.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/4baafc81d2d191397f8f8bba0e1d271595638e99vRZ9r&quot;&gt;Bouldin 2: Down Home Sit and Stay a While&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Bouldin is a place where you can go dine with friends and not feel rushed. In that way, it reminds me of a lot of places in the Deep South. I chose Adelle for the typeface for this concept because it&#39;s unobtrusive, interesting, and easy to read. It&#39;s almost as if Adelle is inviting you to stay on the words and take your time reading. I went with a cozy color palate. A friendly, deep blue for the background and pale yellow, blue, green, and grey for the text.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/1b79e4448ac6f800173b29b266982e87dd4aa19bYx4DB8&quot;&gt;Bouldin 3: Sunny/Frog/Cacti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Looking at Bouldin&#39;s frog logo, past the cacti on a sunny day is the inspiration for this concept. For the h elements, I used the outdoorsy Chippewa Falls typeface. It&#39;s got a retro look and is inspired by signs at Chippewa Falls, a natural spring in Wisconsin. For the rest of the elements, I used DejaRip. For colors, I chose a bright Texas sky blue, bright orange-red and red-orange, a deep blue, and a cacti green.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/541d517616ba8c4d758e714ee0699b641685b7efM&quot;&gt;Bouldin 4: Old Auto Shop Meets Bouldin 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;The current Bouldin location is an old auto shop. They have tires hanging from the ceiling and kept some of the old lettering in the windows. I paired the auto shop idea with the sit and stay a while idea and my brain couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I used Orgovan Rounded for the h elements and menu item names. It&#39;s very similar to the lettering in the window. I kept the rest in Adelle and kept the colors the same as concept 2.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/6b09c30f21c622e9f3a1d6fd4362df504ddbaafcFZfmf&quot;&gt;Bouldin 5: Simple and Comfortable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Bouldin is a simple and comfortable place. Runda is a simple, easy to read typeface. I kept the colors simple and easy to read as well and incorporated comfortable colors like a deep, friendly blue and a bright yellow.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/35a1fd7df7c259cbd72e41ea3cf9616d00077922z4ZW&quot;&gt;Bouldin 6: Artsy and Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Bouldin is artsy and indie in decor and people: from the rotating artists&#39; work, stickers covering the front door, bicycle wheel chandeliers, the vegetable strong man painting, and the mural out back to the people who work and frequent there. I chose Raleway for the typeface. It&#39;s strong, stands out, and unlike any other typeface I&#39;ve seen. I went with a deep teal background and white, light blue, and bright yellow colors. Friendly, unique, and complementary. Because of layout limitations of Typecast, this one ended up no where near how I imagined it would.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/fef20abcf7e78751f45c605850f95c45f24c5fb0&quot;&gt;Bouldin 7: Friendly and Home-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Everyone at Bouldin is the nicest person you&#39;ve ever met and going to Bouldin feels like going to your second home. Rooney is the typeface for this concept. It feels rooted in the page, like it couldn&#39;t be moved even if you tried. It&#39;s also easy to rea --&gt;
&lt;!-- d and warm. I chose friendly blues, a love inspired red-orange, and a cheery yellow-orange for the colors.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/0d0b1d464b554820829e1134d2b2b5e84871d0d2LC8fBvpkcw&quot;&gt;Bouldin 8: Neon Signs/Old Auto Shop/78704&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;This concept is inspired by Bouldin&#39;s neon sign, its history as an old auto shop, and 78704 in general. The typeface used is Expressway, which is based on the typeface used on interstate signs. I thought this fit perfectly with the old auto shop history and it reminded me of the 78704 bumper sticker that looks like a road sign. I used a black background with bright red, green, blue, and yellow, colors found on their neon sign.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/80bfb7f7bf0c4f63275cc9713bbdf062952bb7fecjcWVjx&quot;&gt;Bouldin 9: Eclectic and Authentic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;As quirky as Bouldin is, none of it is an act. It&#39;s a place where you can be who you are. I chose Montserrat for the typeface for h elements. It&#39;s based on old posters and signs found in the Montserrat neighborhood in Buenos Aires and is an eclectic typeface without being over the top. For the rest of the elements, I chose Open Sans. It pairs well with Montserrat and since it is a humanistic sans-serif, it feels real and authentic. For colors, I chose a deep teal background (both quirky and friendly/inviting) and used many of the colors from concept 8.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typecast.com/LztJHqWh7X/share/2543348512b36c635eb40e24dc8cc1d0424d81c76gwb&quot;&gt;Bouldin 10: Quintessential Family/Friends/Date Night Spot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Bouldin was the first place I ate in Austin, my favorite date spot, and the place I take all of my out of town guests. I chose Freight Sans Pro for the typeface. It feels friendly, inviting, and fun. I used many of the same cozy colors I did in concepts 2 and 4. I added in a pink because one of the words that came up a lot was &quot;love&quot; and I felt it important to incorporate that in this concept.&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

        <title>Web Typography Codepens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we started talking about typography and I loved every second of it. I&#39;ve been interested in typography for a while and I&#39;m so pumped to be nerding out about it and learning as much about it as we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start the day off, we watched Helvetica, a documentary about the ubiquitous font and how it&#39;s shaped decades of typography. While watching the film, it became very clear to me that I&#39;m a modernist. Minimal, organized, sturdy. I&#39;m glad to have some perspective and focus on that now and can&#39;t wait to design something of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of tonight&#39;s homework was to find inspiration in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.designishistory.com/&quot;&gt;Design Is History&lt;/a&gt; and create Codepens based on our inspiration. Notice a trend?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Responsive Sketches</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Responsive Sketches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re diving head first into RWD (from a global-first approach) and it is fascinating. RWD isn&#39;t magically going to tackle all of the challenges web designers face, but I think it&#39;s brilliant that there is a design approach that requires us as designers to think about accessibility and inclusiveness from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To practice what we&#39;re learning, we were assigned fixed-width websites of five local businesses to create responsive sketches for. When sketching, we couldn&#39;t just take the same larger site and scale it down; we had to consider different content needs for each breakpoint. A couple days later, we had to create another set of responsive sketches for the same sites. I really liked iterating the sketching process and thinking of new ideas for the same content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;PTerry&#39;s:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-float-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/PTerrys1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of PTerrys responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/PTerrys2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of PTerrys responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that the focus on the smallest screen should be the menu and nutritional/allergy information. You&#39;re on the run and want to see if PTerry&#39;s has anything that you want to/can eat. On the first sketch, I included the story of how they began that&#39;s prominent on their current homepage. Because of its positioning, I could tell it was very important content to them and I wanted to be respectful of that. On the second sketch of the smallest screen, I ditched it and replaced it with a map of their locations and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Salt Lick:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-float-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/SaltLick1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Salt Lick responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/SaltLick2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Salt Lick responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lick&#39;s current website feels very busy and the content feels lost because of that. On both of the sketches I did for their site, I made the content more prominent by using white space and simplifying the layout. On the second sketch, I brought in a carousel of images for the medium and largest size screens. This way, they can showcase various parts of their business, like the barbeque itself and their wedding catering. Keeping it contained to one spot on the page feels a lot less cluttered and gives the other content more of a chance to stand out and be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tarka:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-float-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Tarka1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Tarka responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Tarka2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Tarka responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&#39;t much that I changed about the current Tarka site on my first round of sketches. It&#39;s a simple grid system with colors that make you hungry, which is great for a menu page of a restaurant&#39;s website. I changed the layout and introduced more pictures in the largest breakpoint of the second sketch. I thought good quality and well shot photos of their food would be a great addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fair Bean Coffee:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-float-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/FairBean1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Fair Bean responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/FairBean2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Fair Bean responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first sketch, I thought that the main content across all breakpoints should be the coffee and their business ethics/philosophy. I wanted to make everything bigger and include a full width image with their name and tagline on it. I was so set on this idea, I didn&#39;t consider different content for different screen sizes. In the second sketches, I added their coffee and tea menus and location to the smallest screen size. I also added space for more photos to the medium and largest size screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;ABGB:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-float-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ABGB1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of AGBG responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ABGB2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of AGBG responsive website&quot; class=&quot;post-float-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the layout similar to their existing website in my first set of sketches. The only major difference was I gave more prominence to the location and hours and took away the Twitter feed and archive. In the second set of sketches, I decided priority should be give to news and their beer and food menus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Basic Responsive Codepens</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Basic Responsive Codepens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our first Responsive Web Design (RWD) lecture on Friday. RWD means designing for all sorts of devices and screens. RWD means being inclusive and inclusiveness is my jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, we had a few homework assignments to get used to RWD where we had to use percentages, media queries, and breakpoints. RWD is oddly comforting to me and makes me feel like I have more control over my code and therefore more control over the user’s experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the Codepens I created with this weekend’s homework. If you click on the “Edit on Codepen” link in the upper right hand of each, they’ll open in a new tab and you’ll be able to resize the browser window to see all of their responsive glory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sketches and Perfectionism</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketches-and-perfectionism&quot;&gt;Sketches and Perfectionism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first website sketching assignment sent me into a state of panic. I had to fight my inner perfectionist and accept having what I considered major flaws in my work (and consequently share work I wasn’t proud of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were assigned ten websites that we had to sketch on a grid. And we had to use pen. PEN. I knew I would make mistakes and there would be nothing I could do to correct them and that’s when the panic began. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My instructor, Sam, talked about how sketches don’t have to be perfect, how they shouldn’t be perfect. They’re an important first step in the design process and they should be done quickly to get ideas down on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounded great until I started drawing crooked lines and divs in the wrong place. Even though I knew my sketches shouldn’t be perfect, I put pressure on myself to make them so. I felt like they couldn’t be used because they had mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to share our worst sketch the next day in class. I was terrified at first, but then I realized we all had mistakes. Lines weren’t straight, proportions were off, etc. What I had built up to be horrendous mistakes &lt;em&gt;weren’t mistakes at all&lt;/em&gt;. The layouts of the sites were still conveyed and we could understand what the others had sketched. And that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/first-sketches.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;A couple of my first sketches.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Perseverance</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-perseverance&quot;&gt;On Perseverance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending The Iron Yard is one of the most demanding, challenging, inspiring, and rewarding experiences I’ve ever had. I’m just over two weeks in and I’m amazed by how much I’ve learned, and how much more I’ll learn in the next two and a half months. The days can be long and the assignments push the limits of what I know. It’s all worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I quickly realized is that perseverance is key to getting the most out of this experience. Giving up on a hard problem or concept is not an option. New material gets introduced every day and builds on what we’ve already learned—to say class moves quickly is an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to dig deep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dig deep into the material. I can’t just read the material, I have to make sure I understand it. Sometimes it clicks right away and sometimes I have to explore other reliable resources or make a list of questions for class the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dig deep into the code. If something isn’t working, I have to take a break so that I can look at my code with a fresh set of eyes (for me, this means closing my computer and taking a walk). Did I forget a semicolon at the end of a CSS declaration? Did I forget that inline-block elements are weird and include any white space from HTML? Did I link to my Sass file instead of my CSS file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have to dig deep into myself. I know I can do this. I know that I know more than I think I do. Keeping this at the forefront can be difficult at times, but having a self-defeating attitude creates a doomsday spiral no one wants to go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about The Iron Yard is that no one has to go it alone. If I’m stumped, I have plenty of people around me who I can ask for help, who can be a sounding board, and who can point me in the right direction. When I figure out a challenging concept, I have people to high five. Persevering is a lot easier with a supportive community, and I’m thankful to be part of this one. &lt;/p&gt;
