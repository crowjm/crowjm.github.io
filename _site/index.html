        </h2>
        <p>I had a blast with this assignment. It very much felt like a summer camp activity and it was a really fun way to get comfortable with not editing in my head. I learned that putting down the obvious, just getting it out of my system, helps me move past it and onto better design.</p>

        <p>Iteration helps you move past the obvious, explore ideas fully, and craft the best work possible. Because of iteration, I felt like I was getting to put all of my effort into the best concepts, and that's a satisfying feeling.</p>

        <p>It sounds like a ton of work (and it was), but we kept a steady pace. Breaking it into smaller assignments to accomplish each day made the project seem much less overwhelming. As my Mama says, "the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time."</p>

        <p>RWD isn't magically going to tackle all of the challenges web designers face, but I think it's brilliant that there is a design approach that requires us as designers to think about accessibility and inclusiveness from the get go.</p>
